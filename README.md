### Getting Started
* Close any Neopets tabs you have open.
* Install this extension.
* Open a new tab and go to Neopets. Or click <a href="http://www.neopets.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Usage
* You should see an icon on the right side of the address bar, next to the bookmark icon. (If you don't see it, try refreshing the page.) It should look something like this:

The actual icon you see might be different because it defaults to whichever theme you have selected.

* Click on the icon to bring up the control panel. Then click on any theme to set it as your site theme. :)
